ðŸ§  System Overview

This project implements an end-to-end dining recommendation system using AWS services â€” integrating Lex, SQS, Lambda, OpenSearch, DynamoDB, SES, and EventBridge.

ðŸ§© Workflow
	1.	User Interaction
	    â€¢	The user chats with Lex via the web front end.
	    â€¢	Lex collects user inputs including:
            â€¢	Location
            â€¢	Cuisine type
            â€¢   Dining time
            â€¢	Number of people
            â€¢	Email address
	2.	Message Queue
        â€¢	Lex sends the collected information to an SQS Queue.
	3.	Automated Lambda Trigger
        â€¢	EventBridge triggers Lambda Function LF2 every minute.
	4.	Lambda (LF2) Execution Flow
        â€¢	Reads user requests from the SQS queue.
        â€¢	Randomly retrieves several restaurant IDs from OpenSearch based on the cuisine.
        â€¢	Fetches restaurant details from DynamoDB.
        â€¢	Formats the recommendation results.
        â€¢	Sends an email to the user via Amazon SES.
